# Sherwood Architecture

The Sherwood Architecture is a custom 64-Bit RISC based CPU architecture. It is designed to be lightweight, fast, and powerful. This repository comes with the circuit schematics, compilers, debug and boot firmware, and a virtual machine for running the CPU. Our goal is also aimed to people interested in programming and hardware design so we've designed the architecture to be friendly to everyone.
